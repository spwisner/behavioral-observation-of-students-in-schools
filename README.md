# Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools

## Application Overview

Behavioral Observation of Students in Schools (BOSS), is a tool used by school counselors to collect data on how a target student behaves in relation to other students in the class.  Using timed intervals, counselors can identify behavior as being either engaged or off-task.  Engaged behavior has two categories - actively engaged (aet) and passively engaged (pet).  Off-task behavior has three subcategories - off-task motor (oft-m), off-task verbal (oft-v) and off-task passive (oft-p).  This application allows counselors to make one of five selections during user set time intervals.  After an observation session is complete, users can have a report generated and can access reports using a user dashboard.

## Application Approach & Design

When designing the application, user stories and wireframes were created to ensure that the app would best fit the needs of school counselors.

### User-Stories
The following is a sample of user stories that were considered in the production of the application.

1. As a user, I would like to be able to have my observation auto-submitted
2. As a user, I would like to spend as much time as possible observing the student (rather than the timer)
3. As a user, I would like to edit my previous submit in case an error was made
4. As a user, I would like to create a report
5. As a user, I would like to have a graph displayed of the results

### Wireframes
Based on the user-stories, mulitiple wireframes were created for this application.  They can be found at the followings links
